# SimpleDriverPractice_NEOs
A project for controlling a simple drive base that uses NEO motors

This project is for controlling team 3238's test robot that uses 
4 Neos/SparkMAXs for the drivetrain. If you need a test project 
that uses some other type of motors on the drivetrain it would be 
best to create a new project.
